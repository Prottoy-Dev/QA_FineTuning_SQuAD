# QA_FineTuning_SQuAD
This project demonstrates fine-tuning a transformer-based model for Question Answering (QA) using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). The notebook walks through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference steps.
# ðŸ”¹ Key Features
>Uses Hugging Face Transformers for model implementation.
>Prepares and tokenizes SQuAD dataset for training.
>Fine-tunes a pre-trained transformer model for extractive QA.
>Evaluates model performance with standard QA metrics (EM & F1).
>Provides examples of inference on custom questions.
# âš¡ Use Case
This project can serve as a starting point for building custom QA systems, chatbots, or domain-specific knowledge retrieval applications.
