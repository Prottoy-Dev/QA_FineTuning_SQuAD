# QA_FineTuning_SQuAD
This project demonstrates fine-tuning a transformer-based model for Question Answering (QA) using the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). The notebook walks through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference steps.
# 🔹 Key Features
> Uses Hugging Face Transformers for model implementation.

>	Prepares and tokenizes SQuAD dataset for training.

>	Fine-tunes a pre-trained transformer model for extractive QA.

>	Evaluates model performance with standard QA metrics (EM & F1).

>	Provides examples of inference on custom questions.

# ⚡ Use Case
This project can serve as a starting point for building custom QA systems, chatbots, or domain-specific knowledge retrieval applications.
